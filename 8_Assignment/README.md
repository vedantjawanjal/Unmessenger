# House-Price-Prediction🏠🏠🏠🏠🏠🏠🏠
This repository contains all the files of a deployed model.

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Washington, taking into account various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. With a dataset containing 18 columns of valuable information, we've employed data science and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that can assist in estimating house prices accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project has been taken from Kaggle.
The link for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata

This dataset includes the following columns:

date: The date of the sale.
price: The price of the house.
bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.
sqft_living: The square footage of the living space.
sqft_lot: The size of the lot.
floors: The number of floors in the house.
waterfront: Whether the property has waterfront access.
view: A rating of the view from the property.
condition: The overall condition of the house.
sqft_above: The square footage of the house above ground.
sqft_basement: The square footage of the basement.
yr_built: The year the house was built.
yr_renovated: The year of the last renovation.
street: The street where the property is located.
city: The city where the property is situated.
statezip: The state and ZIP code.
country: The country where the property is located.


## Methodology
We have applied a range of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to create a robust prediction model. These techniques involve data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection.

## Getting Started
Steps used to build this project:

Import Dependencies: Import the required Python libraries.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between features.

Data Preprocessing: Before running the model, you'll need to preprocess the dataset. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Model Building: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. You can experiment with various algorithms and hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared.

Usage: You can use the trained model to predict house prices in Washington based on input data.
